    "executive_summary": "A distributed denial‑of‑service attack is overwhelming the network, with 20% of nodes showing abnormal traffic patterns. The attack is already impacting service availability and could grow if not stopped immediately.",
    "detailed_report_simple": "The network has 20 devices but only 4 connections, meaning traffic is highly concentrated. Four servers (IDs 1, 5, 9, 12) are behaving oddly: Server‑1 is connected to two nodes but has very low centrality, while Servers‑5, 9, and 12 have no connections at all, indicating they may be compromised or misconfigured. This pattern is typical of a botnet sending flood traffic to a few targets, causing a denial‑of‑service. The attack was detected because the anomaly detection engine flagged the sudden drop in connectivity and the high probability score (87%).",
    "root_cause": {
      "what_went_wrong": "The network was flooded with traffic from compromised devices, causing legitimate connections to be dropped or ignored. The lack of connections on several servers suggests they were either taken offline by the attacker or misconfigured to accept no traffic.",
      "how_attackers_exploit": "Attackers use botnets to send massive amounts of requests to a target, exhausting bandwidth and processing resources. By isolating a few nodes, they can make the rest of the network appear disconnected, which is what we see with the zero‑degree servers.",
      "why_detected_now": "The anomaly detection system monitors node degree and betweenness; the sudden appearance of zero‑degree nodes and the drop in clustering coefficient triggered an alert. The high probability score indicates the system has learned this pattern is likely malicious."
