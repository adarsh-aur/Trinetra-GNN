    "detailed_reasoning": "The GNN model identified nodes 15, 21, and 59 as outliers with Z\u2011scores exceeding 5, indicating statistically significant deviations from normal traffic patterns. Node 15\u2019s high degree and moderate betweenness suggest it is a hub that can influence many connections, making it an ideal pivot for attackers. The identified attack paths (15\u20115\u201121, 15\u201199\u201159, 21\u20113\u20118\u201159) reveal a clear lateral movement strategy, moving from a compromised node to adjacent nodes with lower clustering coefficients, which typically represent less monitored or less secure segments. The absence of CVE data in the current snapshot indicates that the attack may rely on credential theft or exploitation of unpatched software not yet cataloged, or on misconfigurations such as open ports or weak authentication. The root cause analysis points to systemic gaps: lack of MFA, insufficient network segmentation, and outdated software. Immediate isolation of the affected nodes stops the spread, while a full vulnerability scan and patching address the underlying weaknesses. Implementing MFA and segmentation provides a robust barrier against future lateral movement. Continuous monitoring and playbooks ensure that any future anomalies are detected and responded to quickly, protecting business operations and compliance obligations. Failure to act promptly could lead to data exfiltration, regulatory fines, and significant reputational damage.",
