Node 5, the highest\u2011scoring hub (degree 20, low clustering 0.105), is a natural conduit for lateral movement; its anomalous score (12.02) coupled with a critical CVE (CVE\u20112025\u201100123) suggests an exploited service that can pivot traffic. Node 28 (degree 6, clustering 0.067) and node 60 (degree 4, clustering 0.167) form a critical path (28\u20115\u201160) with high anomaly scores (13.32 and 20.40 respectively). The presence of CVE\u20112025\u201100456 on node 28 and CVE\u20112025\u201100789 on node 60 indicates that these nodes are running vulnerable software that can be leveraged for privilege escalation or data exfiltration. Node 95, with a zero clustering coefficient, is an isolated endpoint that may have been compromised via a supply\u2011chain or phishing vector; the critical CVE (CVE\u20112025\u201101012) on this node further elevates risk. The isolated nodes (105, 128, 160, 195, 205, 228) have degree 0, implying they are disconnected from the main graph\u2014often a sign of a compromised host that has been isolated by the network or is a staging point for an attacker. The combination of high anomaly scores, low clustering, and critical CVEs across these nodes warrants a CRITICAL severity classification.",
