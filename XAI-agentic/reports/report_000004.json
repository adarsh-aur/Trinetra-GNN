    "reasoning": "The GNN flagged node 69 with the highest anomaly score (16.44) and a z\u2011score of 6.37, indicating a statistically significant deviation from normal graph behavior. Node 69 has a very low clustering coefficient (0.0) and only three neighbors, suggesting it is a potential bridge or isolated point that could be exploited for lateral movement. Node 21 also shows a high anomaly score (12.56) and moderate clustering (0.11), implying it may be a central hub with abnormal traffic patterns. The critical paths identified (21\u201111\u201169, 21\u20111\u201148\u201192, 69\u201122\u20115\u201140\u201192) connect these anomalous nodes to other parts of the network, forming potential attack corridors.\n\nExternal CVE intelligence returned no known CVEs for the affected nodes, which means the anomalies are likely due to misconfigurations, zero\u2011day vulnerabilities, or undocumented software issues. The absence of CVEs reduces the immediate risk level, but the high anomaly scores and the presence of critical paths still warrant a medium severity assessment. Confidence is moderate (0.6) because the lack of CVE data introduces uncertainty about the true threat vector.\n\nIn the absence of identified CVEs, the focus shifts to hardening the network: ensuring all software is up\u2011to\u2011date, tightening access controls on the anomalous nodes, and monitoring traffic along the critical paths for suspicious activity.",
