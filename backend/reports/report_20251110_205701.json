    "severity": "CRITICAL",
    "confidence": 0.92,
    "executive_summary": "All 15 nodes in the network are flagged as anomalous, with three clear attack paths converging on a high‑centrality node (192.168.7.23). This indicates a coordinated lateral movement that could compromise critical assets if left unchecked.",
    "detailed_report_simple": "The network scan shows every node exhibiting abnormal behavior, and the graph analysis reveals three distinct paths that attackers could use to move from initially compromised hosts to a central hub. The hub node has the highest degree and betweenness, making it a prime target for further exploitation. The detection occurred because the monitoring system flagged unusual traffic patterns and connectivity anomalies, triggering the alert. Immediate containment and remediation are essential to prevent data loss or service disruption.",
    "root_cause": {
      "what_went_wrong": "Weak or reused credentials, lack of network segmentation, and outdated software allowed attackers to gain footholds on multiple hosts and move laterally.",
      "how_attackers_exploit": "Once inside one node, attackers leveraged open SMB/SSH services and unpatched vulnerabilities to access neighboring machines, then used the identified paths to reach the high‑centrality node, which likely hosts sensitive data or critical services.",
      "why_detected_now": "The security monitoring platform uses graph‑based anomaly detection; the sudden increase in cross‑node connections and the appearance of new attack paths triggered the alert."
