Node 30 has the highest anomaly score (19.26) and a z\u2011score of 6.93, far above the typical threshold of 3.0. Node 10 and node 71 also exhibit high anomaly scores and are connected via critical paths (10\u20113\u201130, 10\u201152\u201171, 30\u201113\u201182). These paths provide a low\u2011clustering, high\u2011betweenness route that an attacker could exploit for lateral movement. The presence of 5 vulnerable paths and 20 critical nodes suggests that the attacker may be moving through the network, potentially exploiting CVEs on these nodes. The combination of high anomaly scores, critical path connectivity, and the number of critical nodes warrants a CRITICAL assessment.",
