The top five anomalous nodes (39, 43, 110, 112, 119) exhibit high anomaly scores and z-scores, with node 43 at the maximum. Node 39 is a hub connecting to the central node 0 and to node 174, forming critical paths that link multiple high-risk nodes. This topology suggests a potential lateral movement vector through node 0, a likely gateway or core switch. The presence of multiple critical paths involving the same hub amplifies the risk of rapid spread. Given the high anomaly scores and the centrality of the affected nodes, the situation warrants immediate isolation and investigation.",
