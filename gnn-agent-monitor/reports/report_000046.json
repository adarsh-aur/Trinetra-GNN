The top anomalous nodes (23, 28, 61, 104) have z\u2011scores above 3, with node 104 exceeding 5.5, a clear outlier. Critical paths connect node 23 to node 104 via node 4, and to nodes 26 and 28 via intermediate nodes 5 and 6. This topology suggests a potential lateral movement chain from a compromised node (23) to a high\u2011value target (104) and other vulnerable nodes. The presence of 20 critical nodes and 5 vulnerable paths further elevates the risk. Given the high anomaly scores and the connectivity of these nodes, the situation warrants immediate containment and remediation.",
