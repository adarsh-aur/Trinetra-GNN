Node 3, a high\u2011degree hub, exhibits a very high anomaly score (13.43) and a z\u2011score of 3.53, indicating significant deviation from expected behavior. It also lies on all three critical paths to nodes 72, 116, and 57, which are themselves anomalous with z\u2011scores ranging from 3.00 to 5.50. The clustering coefficients are low, suggesting that these nodes are acting as bridges rather than tightly knit communities, a pattern typical of lateral movement or command\u2011and\u2011control activity. The presence of 5 vulnerable paths further increases the risk of rapid spread. Combined, these indicators point to a likely compromise that could propagate quickly through the network.",
