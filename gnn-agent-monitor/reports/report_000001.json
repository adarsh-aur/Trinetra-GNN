The top five anomalous nodes (IDs 1, 14, 53, 58, 76) are all isolated (degree 0, betweenness 0, clustering 0) yet exhibit extremely high anomaly scores and z\u2011scores. This pattern strongly suggests either misconfiguration (e.g., missing links) or that these hosts have been compromised and are deliberately severed from normal traffic to avoid detection. The absence of critical paths does not mitigate the risk; isolated nodes can serve as stealthy footholds for lateral movement or data exfiltration once an attacker gains initial access.",
