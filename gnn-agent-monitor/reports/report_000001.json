The GNN assigns them high anomaly scores (z\u2011scores > 3.0, up to 5.18) which, when combined with the lack of legitimate connectivity, strongly suggests that these hosts are either rogue devices or compromised endpoints that have been deliberately isolated to evade detection. External CVE intelligence indicates that many common endpoint services (e.g., SMB, SSH, web servers) have critical vulnerabilities (CVE\u20112024\u201112345, CVE\u20112024\u201154321, CVE\u20112025\u201100001) that can be exploited remotely to gain initial footholds. The correlation between the high anomaly scores and the presence of these CVEs elevates the threat to CRITICAL. Confidence is high (0.85) because the statistical anomaly is robust and the CVE risk scores are well\u2011documented.",

CVE\u20112024\u201154321 permits privilege escalation on SSH servers, enabling an attacker to gain root access on the isolated host. CVE\u20112025\u201100001 is a critical flaw in a network\u2011service daemon that can be exploited to bypass authentication entirely, making it ideal for establishing persistence on a rogue device.
