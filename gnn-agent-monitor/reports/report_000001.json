The top five anomalies are isolated nodes (degree 0, no neighbors) yet exhibit extremely high anomaly scores and z\u2011scores (up to 8.4). This pattern is typical of compromised hosts that have been disconnected from the network to avoid detection or of data ingestion errors that flag legitimate nodes as outliers. The presence of multiple isolated high\u2011score nodes suggests a coordinated compromise or a systemic misconfiguration that could allow an attacker to pivot or exfiltrate data. Given the potential for rapid lateral movement and data loss, the situation warrants immediate attention.",
