Node 40 exhibits the highest anomaly score (23.36) and a z-score of 9.98, suggesting a severe deviation from expected behavior. Node 33 also shows a high anomaly score (15.19) and a z-score of 6.25. Node 11, while less extreme, acts as a central hub connecting to both 33 and 40 via critical paths, implying potential lateral movement or pivoting. The clustering coefficient of node 40 is 0, indicating it may be a bridge node with no redundant connections, making it a single point of failure. The presence of multiple high-anomaly nodes along short critical paths strongly suggests an active compromise or coordinated attack, warranting immediate isolation and investigation.",
