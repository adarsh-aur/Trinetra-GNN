These nodes are connected via short critical paths (48\u201347\u2013117, 48\u201345\u2013159, 117\u20132\u20134\u2013133), creating a high\u2011risk corridor that could facilitate lateral movement or data exfiltration.  The low clustering coefficients and small degrees of the anomalous nodes suggest they may be isolated points of compromise rather than benign outliers.  Combined, these factors point to an active or imminent threat scenario.",
