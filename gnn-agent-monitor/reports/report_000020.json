These nodes form critical paths that connect each other, indicating a likely compromised pivot point (node 16) that can reach other high-risk nodes (24, 37) and intermediate nodes (56, 64). The clustering coefficients and betweenness centrality suggest that node 16 is a hub, making it a prime candidate for lateral movement and privilege escalation.
