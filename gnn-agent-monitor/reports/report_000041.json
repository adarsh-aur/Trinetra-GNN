Node 12 exhibits the highest anomaly score (17.19) and a z-score of 4.58, indicating a statistically significant deviation. Node 137 has the maximum z-score (5.00) and is part of two critical paths (12\u21922\u2192137 and 137\u219236\u2192144). These nodes are low-degree but high betweenness, making them potential pivot points for lateral movement. The presence of three short critical paths suggests an attacker could traverse from node 12 to nodes 61, 137, and 144 in a single hop, potentially reaching other critical assets. The combination of high anomaly scores, critical path proximity, and low clustering (indicating isolated but influential nodes) warrants a CRITICAL assessment.",
