Node 52 has the highest anomaly score (19.66) and a z\u2011score of 5.94, indicating a statistically significant deviation. It lies at the intersection of three critical paths (16\u201148\u201152, 52\u201117\u201153, 41\u20114\u201153), making it a central pivot for potential lateral movement. Nodes 16, 41, 53, and 144 also exhibit high anomaly scores and low clustering, suggesting isolated, potentially compromised activity. The presence of 5 vulnerable paths further increases the likelihood of an attacker traversing the network. Combined, these factors point to a high\u2011severity threat scenario that could lead to privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or service disruption if not addressed immediately.",
